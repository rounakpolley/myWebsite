    <p class="bodyContentsCenter">Hi, and welcome to my website.</p><br/>
    <p>
    I'm <i>Rounak Polley</i> and am a computer science student. I like to code ! (Which is pretty much expected from me I guess). But, what I love doing the most is building websites.<br/><br/>
    I mostly do designing and front-end development. I believe that not only does a website needs to interactive and
    responsive it should also be beautiful are attractive.<br/>
    Different types of websites need different functionality and designs depending upon the type of website and 
    the users who are likely to use it the most. Which means that one simply cannot copy-paste the designs and
    codes. This is where the front-end developers and designers come in.
    Because with millions of websites out there creating something that actually delivers according to user 
    expectations is tricky (difficult is certainly not the term here).

    <p class="bodyContentsCenter"><strong>You need a website? I will do it for you.</strong></p><br/>
    <p>
    Billions of people use the internet every day from various devices ranging from smartwatches and smartphones to laptops and desktop computers. They might be looking for answers for their questions or just browsing for maybe looking for a product online better yet connecting with their friends on social media platforms. Bulk of the internet functionality as we know it is provided by millions of websites across the globe.
    And I can build you a stunning website that people will love to visit!

    <h3 class="bodyContentsCenter">Why do you should have a personal website ?</h3>
    <p>
    So, web is very popular and effective in promoting expanding your business (may be your startup) or establishing your identity. Social media platforms are good (but, let's face it they are not great almost everybody has one!). It's all about making a mark, creating an impression. And if you are wondering owning a personal website is not at all costly it can easily be done starting with a few hundred dollars.
    What are you waiting for?
